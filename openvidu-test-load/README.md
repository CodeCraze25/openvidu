# OpenVidu Test Load

This repository aims to facilitate the definition, execution and review of massive load testing scenarios of an OpenVidu application in a distributed cluster of containerized browsers, located in Amazon Web Services Cloud.

Number of total sessions and participants must be customizable. Test will have the following default conditions:

- Every participant will be connecting from a single browser. Eveyr browser will be launched in its own Docker container with fixed resource configuration (available RAM, number of cores and bandwidth)
- Every browser will be a Chrome instance launched with the following options: `allow-file-access-from-files`, `use-file-for-fake-video-capture=fakevideo.y4m`, `use-file-for-fake-audio-capture=fakeaudio.wav`, `window-size=1980,1280`
- OpenVidu will be deployed in a dedicated EC2 machine. Every OpenVidu session (and therefore every dockerized browser) will be connecting to this same instance
- Each session will have 7 participants (7 publishers and 42 subscribers)
- Each video will have a resolution of 540Ã—360 pixels, 30 fps
- Each browser will be responsible of obtaining the necessary token to connect to its specific test session (URL will contain as parameters the secret, the session identifier and the ip where to perform REST operations, so the JavaScript code can get the token)
- Any kind of complexity in the client code will be avoided: just HTML videos displaying the local and remote streams
- Every RTCPeerConnection object will be exposed to gather statistics thanks to method getStats()
- The following statistics will be the ones gathered for each RTCPeerConnection object: Sender Round-Trip-Time (googRtt), Receviers Round-Trip-Time (googRtt), Received Bit-Rate, Sent Bit-Rate, Packet loss
- Every browser will be monitored to ensure each one of the 7 videos is playing media

The testing process for every client node will be:

1. Launch Chrome with the required flags (selenium code in the test orchestrator will launch every client node)
2. Wait fot the testing web application to load. This static web app will be hosted in the same EC22 machine as OpenVidu Server. RECORD TIME
3. Wait for the browser to connect to the session in OpenVidu Server (`connectionCreated` event). RECORD TIME
4. Wait for the local video to be playing (`videoPlaying` event). RECORD TIME
5. Wait for each one of the 6 remote videos to be playing (`videoPlaying` event). RECORD TIME
6. Gather statistics. Each call to getStats over each RTCPeerConnection object (7 calls to getStats in total) will take place every second, n times (n=8 by default)
7. Close browser
